# mac-alfred-workflows
A collection of macOS scripts, tools and tips we share for Alfred 3.

## Get Working 

The `Get Working.alfredworkflow` extends the functionality of the macOS Alfred utility. It has two commands: 

* **`start`** will launch important work related applications
* **`stop`** will close Intel-specific applications

Note that these two list are not identical intentionally. I do *not* want to auto-quit Chrome or Evernote when I finish work. You may differ and I welcome forks that customize to your needs. Pull requests or edits are also welcome if you have some better practices to share.
